# TASK-PROMPTED MEDIA

# Problem

Most compelling content includes more than one medium - text, photography, graphics, etc. 

In order to coordinate the production of this content, editors can create tasks to request colloboration from team's with different skills.

If the team decides to take on the work, they'll accept the task and dole out the assignment. 

At that point, the media is either created (the sidebar is written, the graphic is created) or sourced (an appropriate asset is found on the wires or in the archive). 

Now that the media exists, the editor who originally commisionshed the work needs a way to easily locate it. This doesn't exist today within Arc. 

Allowing content creators to tag media with task IDs will make it easy to find work that is produced as the result of a task.

# Proposal

A new field, TK, will allow an array of Task IDs to be associated with any content inside of Arc.

## New field

# Example

```
